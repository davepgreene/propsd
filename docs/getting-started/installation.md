# How to install propsd #

[Releases of propsd][releases] include both source tarballs and Debian
packages. Debian and Ubuntu based Linux distributions can use the pre-built
packages. Other operating systems should install propsd from source.

## Installing from the Debian package ##

on Debian based systems][node-debian].

page][releases] and save it. These instructions assume you've saved the package
to `/tmp/propsd.deb`.

Use `dpkg` to install propsd.

~~~bash
dpkg -i /tmp/propsd.deb
~~~

Propsd is installed into `/opt/propsd`.

## Installing from source ##

Propsd depends on Node.js, so follow the [instructions for installing Node.js][node-source].

Download a tarball of the propsd sources from [the releases page][releases] and
save it. These instructions assume you've saved the tarball to

Create a new folder for propsd. These instructions assume you're using
`/opt` as that folder.

~~~bash
mkdir /opt
~~~
